# LintCodeSolution

This repository contains my solutions for problems on 

[LintCode]: http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/	"LintCode"

. I have been determined to solve every single problem on it. It's not too difficult since I have currently solved 250 plus problems on LeetCode and most problems on these two OJ are exactly the same. LintCode doesn't provide answers(discuss) for its problems, though you can certainly find them on the internet. I'd like to post my answers here. Maybe this repository is not going to be viewed by many people, I wish it could witness my progress in programming.
