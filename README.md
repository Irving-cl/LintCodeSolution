#### LintCode:  http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/

#### Something about this repository:

This repository contains my solutions for problems on LintCode. And all of them will be written in Java(there could be exceptions for some special problems) because I want to practise programming in Java. I'm going to solve every single problem on it. That won't be too difficult since I have already solved 250 plus problems on LeetCode and most problems on these two OJs are totally the same. LintCode doesn't provide answers(discuss) for its problems, though you can certainly find them on the internet. I'd like to post my answers here. Maybe this repository is not going to be viewed by many people, I wish that it could witness my progress in programming.
